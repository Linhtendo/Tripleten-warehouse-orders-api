No, we did not use Express in our previous tasks. Instead, we focused on testing controller logic and mocking service functions directly with Jest, without setting up a real Express app or handling real HTTP requests.

Letâ€™s revise the README.md to remove references to Express and ensure it accurately reflects the tools and techniques we used.

Final Revised README.md Without Express and Supertest
Project Name: Warehouse and Orders API
Description
This project provides an API for managing warehouse data, checking product availability, updating orders, and deleting kits. The project focuses on testing the core logic and ensuring that controllers and services behave as expected, using mocking techniques to simulate data interactions.

Technologies and Techniques Used
Node.js: The runtime environment used for building and executing the API.

Jest: A testing framework used for unit tests, including mocking service functions to simulate interactions with data.

JavaScript (ES6): The primary language used for the project, leveraging features like destructuring and arrow functions.

Mocking with Jest: Jest's mocking capabilities were used to simulate service functions and their interactions without needing a real database.

Endpoints
GET /api/v1/warehouses: Retrieves a list of all warehouses.

POST /api/v1/warehouses/check: Checks the availability of goods in the warehouse.

PUT /api/v1/orders/:id: Updates an existing order by ID.

DELETE /api/v1/kits/:id: Deletes a kit by its ID.

Instructions on How to Run the Tests
To run the tests for this project, follow these steps:

Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have all the project dependencies installed. If you haven't installed them yet, run:

npm install

Run the Tests:
Use the following command to run all the tests in the project:

npm test

This will execute the tests for all the endpoints, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
